# 30DayMapChal

This repository contains exercises to reproduce the work from [Lisa Ho's 30-Day Map Challenge](https://github.com/Lisa-Ho/30-day-map-challenge/tree/main/2022). The purpose of this project is to practice and enhance skills in geospatial data analysis and visualization, in preparation for future geospatial data projects. The notebooks in this repository will mirror the challenge steps and adapt them for personal learning and exploration.
